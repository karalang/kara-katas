# 71. Simplify Path

> **Difficulty:** Medium &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Topics:** String, Stack &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Source:** [leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

Given an absolute Unix-style path, return its canonical form.

A canonical path:

- starts with `/`,
- has each adjacent pair of directories separated by exactly one `/`,
- contains no `.` or `..` navigation tokens,
- does not end with a trailing `/` unless the result is the root itself.

```
"/home/"                            →  "/home"
"/home//foo/"                       →  "/home/foo"
"/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"  →  "/home/user/Pictures"
"/../"                              →  "/"
"/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"             →  "/.../b/d"   ("..." is a name, not a navigation token)
```

**Constraints:** `1 ≤ path.length ≤ 3000`; `path` consists of English letters, digits, `'.'`, `'/'`, `'_'`; `path` is an absolute path starting with `/`.

## Approaches

| Approach | Complexity | Kāra | Python |
|---|---|---|---|
| One-pass scan + (start, end) index stack | O(n) time, O(n) space | [`simplify.kara`](simplify.kara) ✓ via `karac run` / `karac build` | [`simplify.py`](simplify.py) ✓ |

Interpreter and codegen produce identical output to the Python mirror across all 24 test cases in `main`.

## Why a stack — and why index pairs, not strings

The canonical form is determined by what's left on the stack after walking the input. Components fall into three classes:

| Component | Action |
|---|---|
| `'.'` | skip — same directory |
| `'..'` | pop one entry (or stay at root if empty) |
| anything else | push |

A naïve implementation would split the input on `/` into a `Vec[String]`, then push/pop those strings. That works, but allocates a fresh `String` per component and keeps both the input *and* the parts buffer live for the whole walk. The stack here instead holds **`(start, end)` index pairs into the snapshotted input chars** — 16 bytes per entry regardless of how long the component is, and no per-component allocation. The output walk reads characters back out of the input buffer at the recorded positions.

The length is part of the discriminator on purpose. `"..."` is a three-character file name and must be pushed, not interpreted as "parent of parent" — the `/.../a/../b/c/../d/./` LeetCode example exists to catch implementations that look only at the leading byte.

## What this kata uncovered

The first version of this kata couldn't call `Vec.pop` at all — the typechecker accepted it and codegen lowered it, but `karac run` panicked with "method 'pop' not found on type 'unknown'": the interpreter's Vec-method dispatch arm covered `pop_back` / `pop_front` but not the bare `pop` synonym. The kata was the first thing in the corpus to want stack-style push/pop on a `Vec[i64]`, so it surfaced the gap on its first probe.

Per the project's `no workarounds — fix the compiler` discipline, the interpreter dispatch was extended (commit [`7ebb8dd`](../../../../karac-rust/) — `pop` aliased to `pop_back` in `src/interpreter/method_call_seq.rs:207` plus a matching arm in `eval_vec_deque_method`) rather than the kata staying on a `top`-counter simulation of pop. This kata is now the natural integration test for that arm — drop the dispatch and the `'..'` cases (`/../`, `/a/../../b`, `/a/b/c/../..`) immediately panic.

## Kāra features exercised

- **`ref String` + `for c in s.chars()`** — read-only string borrow iterated per Unicode scalar; ASCII input means `chars` and `bytes` would both work, `chars` chosen so f-string append in the output loop avoids a `u8 as char` round-trip.
- **`Vec[char]` snapshot for random access** — `s.chars()` has no `len()` and no random access, but the algorithm needs both (`cs[i + 1]` for the second dot, post-scan position-indexed reads).
- **Parallel `Vec[i64]` start/end stacks with safe-on-empty `pop`** — `Vec.pop` returns `None` on an empty Vec, so the saturate-at-root rule needs no explicit guard; the two stacks stay in lockstep because pushes always go to both together.
- **`and` short-circuit inside `while` and `let` conditions** — `while i < n and cs[i] == slash` is the boundary-safe slash-skip; `is_dotdot` shortcuts the second `cs[]` read when the length doesn't match.
- **f-string interpolation as the String-builder** — `out = f"{out}/"` and `out = f"{out}{c}"` are the available append shape; kara doesn't have `String + String` or `substring` today (both tracked in [`phase-8-stdlib-floor.md`](../../../../karac-rust/docs/implementation_checklist/phase-8-stdlib-floor.md), surfaced from this kata).

No `Map`, no shared structs, no `Vec[String]`.

## Running

```bash
# Kāra — interpreter and codegen both produce the same output today.
karac run   simplify.kara
karac build simplify.kara && ./simplify

# Python
python3 simplify.py

# Verify they agree
diff <(./simplify) <(python3 simplify.py) && echo OK
diff <(karac run simplify.kara) <(python3 simplify.py) && echo OK
